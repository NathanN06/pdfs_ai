Teachers need to know that the new qualifications will assist them in helping their learners make progress in their lives. When these changes were first proposed we were approached by Pearson to join an \u2018Expert Panel\u2019 that would advise them on the development of the new qualifications. We were chosen, either because of our expertise in the UK education system, or because of our experience in reforming qualifications in other systems around the world as diverse as Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia and a number of countries across Europe. We have guided Pearson through what we judge to be a rigorous qualification development process that has included: \u25cf Extensive international comparability of subject content against the"], ["A_Level_Econ_A_Spec.pdf", "highest- performing jurisdictions in the world \u25cf Benchmarking assessments against UK and overseas providers to ensure that they are at the right level of demand \u25cf Establishing External Subject Advisory Groups, drawing on independent subject- specific expertise to challenge and validate our qualifications \u25cf Subjecting the final qualifications to scrutiny against the DfE content and Ofqual accreditation criteria in advance of submission. Importantly, we have worked to ensure that the content and learning is future oriented. The design has been guided by what is called an \u2018Efficacy Framework\u2019, meaning learner outcomes have been at the heart of this development throughout. We understand that ultimately it is excellent teaching that is the key factor to a learner\u2019s success in education. As a result of our work as a panel we are confident that we have supported the development of qualifications that are outstanding for their coherence, thoroughness and attention to detail and can be regarded as representing world-class best practice.

This theme introduces students to the microeconomic nature of economics, looking at economic problems and the ways economists think and work. Students will need to build upon the knowledge, skills and understanding developed from Theme 1 in Theme 3, making connections across these two microeconomic themes for Paper 1, and across Themes 1, 2, 3 and 4 in Paper 3. Teaching approaches to content must reflect this. Students will need to apply their knowledge and understanding to both familiar and unfamiliar contexts in the assessments and demonstrate an awareness of current economic events and policies. Content In this theme students will consider how markets work, looking at how supply and demand interact to allocate resources in local, national and international markets. They"], ["A_Level_Econ_A_Spec.pdf", "will learn how to apply supply and demand analysis to real-world situations and be able to offer explanations of consumer behaviour. This will involve looking at both how consumers act in a rational way to maximise utility and how firms maximise profit, but also why consumers may not behave rationally. Having investigated how markets work, students will then look at market failure. They will look at the nature and causes of market failure before considering the strengths and weaknesses of possible government intervention to remedy market failures. This theme will provide a coherent coverage of microeconomic content with students drawing on local, national and global contexts. Students are encouraged to use an enquiring, critical and thoughtful approach to the study of economics and to develop an ability to think as an economist. To develop their knowledge, skills and understanding in economics, students need to have acquired competence in quantitative skills that are relevant to and applied in the context of this theme (see Appendix 3: Quantitative skills).

2016 \u00a9 Pearson Education Limited 2016 21 Theme 3: Business behaviour and the labour market Overview This theme builds on the content of Theme 1: Introduction to markets and market failure and focuses on business economics. Students will need to build upon the knowledge, skills and understanding developed from Theme 1 in Theme 3, making connections across these two microeconomic themes in Paper 1, and across Themes 1, 2, 3 and 4 in Paper 3. Teaching approaches to content must reflect this. Students will need to apply their knowledge and understanding to both familiar and unfamiliar contexts in the assessments and demonstrate an awareness of current economic events and policies. Content This theme examines how the number and size of market participants, and the level of contestability, affect the pricing and nature of competition among firms. Students will consider the size and growth of firms through exploring organic growth, mergers and takeovers. They will look at the reasons for demergers and why some firms tend to remain small. Students will look at the rational assumption that firms are profit maximisers and then challenge this by looking at alternative business objectives. Revenues, costs and profits are explored before linking these ideas to different market structures. Students will then be able to analyse and evaluate the pricing and output decisions of firms in different contexts and understand the role of competition in business decision making. Supply and demand analysis is specifically applied to the labour market to see how wages are determined in competitive and non-competitive markets. At the end of this theme students should be capable of making an appraisal of government intervention aimed at promoting competitive markets. This theme will provide a coherent coverage of microeconomic content, drawing on local, national and global contexts. Students are encouraged to use an enquiring, critical and thoughtful approach to the study of economics and to develop an ability to think as an economist. To develop their skills, knowledge and understanding in economics, students need to have acquired competence in quantitative skills that are relevant to and applied in the context of this theme (see Appendix 3: Quantitative skills).

This will be the grade for the larger qualification (i.e. the A Level grade rather than the AS grade). If the qualifications are the same size, then the better grade will be counted (please see Appendix 5: Codes). Please note that there are two codes for AS GCE qualifications; one for Key Stage 4 (KS4) performance tables and one for 16\u201319 performance tables. If a KS4 student achieves both a GCSE and an AS with the same discount code, the AS result will be counted over the GCSE result.

They allow students with special educational needs, disabilities or temporary injuries to: \u25cf access the assessment \u25cf show what they know and can do without changing the demands of the assessment. The intention behind an access arrangement is to meet the particular needs of an individual disabled student without affecting the integrity of the assessment. Access arrangements are the principal way in which awarding bodies comply with the duty under the Equality Act 2010 to make \u2018reasonable adjustments\u2019. Access arrangements should always be processed at the start of the course. Students will then know what is available and have the access arrangement(s) in place for assessment. Reasonable adjustments The Equality Act 2010 requires an awarding organisation to make reasonable adjustments where a person with a disability would be at a substantial disadvantage in undertaking an assessment. The awarding organisation is required to take reasonable steps to overcome that disadvantage. A reasonable adjustment for a particular person may be unique to that individual and therefore might not be in the list of available access arrangements. Whether an adjustment will be considered reasonable will depend on a number of factors, which will include: \u25cf the needs of the student with the disability \u25cf the effectiveness of the adjustment \u25cf the cost of the adjustment; and \u25cf the likely impact of the adjustment on the student with the disability and other students. An adjustment will not be approved if it involves unreasonable costs to the awarding organisation, timeframes or affects the security or integrity of the assessment. This is because the adjustment is not \u2018reasonable\u2019. Pearson Edexcel Level 3 Advanced GCE in Economics A Specification \u2013 Issue 2 \u2013 October 2016 \u00a9 Pearson Education Limited 2016 45 Special consideration Special consideration is a post-examination adjustment to a student's mark or grade to reflect temporary injury, illness or other indisposition at the time of the examination/ assessment, which has had, or is reasonably likely to have had, a material effect on a candidate\u2019s ability to take an assessment or demonstrate his or her level of attainment in an assessment.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defines skills, or competencies, as \u2018the bundle of knowledge, attributes and capacities that can be learned and that enable individuals to successfully and consistently perform an activity or task and can be built upon and extended through learning.\u2019 [2] To support the design of our qualifications, the Pearson Research Team selected and evaluated seven global 21st-century skills frameworks. Following on from this process, we identified the National Research Council\u2019s (NRC) framework as the most evidence-based and robust skills framework. We adapted the framework slightly to include the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) ICT Literacy and Collaborative Problem Solving (CPS) Skills. The adapted National Research Council\u2019s framework of skills involves: [3] Cognitive skills \u25cf Non-routine problem solving \u2013 expert thinking, metacognition, creativity. \u25cf Systems thinking \u2013 decision making and reasoning. \u25cf Critical thinking \u2013 definitions of critical thinking are broad and usually involve general cognitive skills such as analysing, synthesising and reasoning skills. \u25cf ICT literacy - access, manage, integrate, evaluate, construct and communicate[4].

The Extended Project is a standalone qualification that can be taken alongside GCEs. It supports the development of independent learning skills and helps to prepare students for their next step \u2013"], ["A_Level_Econ_A_Spec.pdf", "whether that be higher education study or employment. The qualification: \u25cf is recognised by higher education for the skills it develops \u25cf is worth half of an Advanced GCE qualification at grades A*\u2013E \u25cf carries UCAS points for university entry. The Extended Project encourages students to develop skills in the following areas: research, critical thinking, extended writing and project management. Students identify and agree a topic area of their choice (which may or may not be related to a GCE subject they are already studying), guided by their teacher. Students can choose from one of four approaches to produce: \u25cf a dissertation (for example, an investigation based on predominately secondary research) \u25cf an investigation/field study (for example, a practical experiment) \u25cf a performance (for example, in music, drama or sport) \u25cf an artefact (for example, a creating a sculpture in response to a client brief or solving an engineering problem). The qualification is coursework based and students are assessed on the skills of managing, planning and evaluating their project. Students will research their topic, develop skills to review and evaluate the information, and then present the final outcome of their project. Students: what they need to do The Extended Project qualification requires students to: \u25cf select a topic of interest for an in-depth study and negotiate the scope of the project with their teacher \u25cf identify and draft an objective for their project (for example, in the form of a question, hypothesis, challenge, outline of proposed performance, issue to be investigated or commission for a client) and provide a rationale for their choice \u25cf produce a plan for how they will deliver their intended objective \u25cf conduct research as required by the project brief, using appropriate techniques \u25cf carry out the project using tools and techniques safely \u25cf share the outcome of the project using appropriate communication methods, including a presentation.

What is the Extended Project for Economics? The Extended Project creates the opportunity to develop transferable skills for progression to higher education and to the workplace, through the exploration of either an area of personal interest or a topic of interest within the Economics qualification content. Through the study of this Economics qualification, students will develop knowledge and understanding of economic concepts and issues; apply these concepts and issues to real world contexts; then analyse and evaluate these concepts and"], ["A_Level_Econ_A_Spec.pdf", "issues. Skills developed Through the Extended Project, students will develop skills in: \u25cf conducting, organising and using research \u25cf independent reading in the subject area \u25cf planning, project management and time management \u25cf defining a hypothesis to be tested in investigations or developing a design brief \u25cf collecting, handling and interpreting data and evidence \u25cf evaluating arguments and processes, including arguments in favour of alternative interpretations of data and evaluation of experimental methodology \u25cf critical thinking. In the context of the Extended Project, critical thinking refers to the ability to identify and develop arguments for a point of view or hypothesis and to consider and respond to alternative arguments. This supports the development of evaluative skills, through evaluating economic arguments, and using qualitative and quantitative evidence to support informed judgements relating to economic issues. The Extended Project is an ideal vehicle to develop the skills identified in Appendix 1. Pearson Edexcel Level 3 Advanced GCE in Economics A Specification \u2013 Issue 2 \u2013 October 2016 \u00a9 Pearson Education Limited 2016 57 Types of Extended Project Students may choose a university-style dissertation on any topic that can be researched and argued, for example: \u25cf a controversial economic issue such as UK membership of the EU \u25cf High Speed rail (HS2) \u25cf the government\u2019s role in reducing pollution. A dissertation might involve an investigation such as: \u25cf Is fair trade actually fair? \u25cf Does income inequality help or harm economic growth? \u25cf Taxing wealth is less harmful than taxing income or spending. The dissertation uses secondary research sources to provide a reasoned defence or a point of view, with consider of counter arguments. An alternative might be an investigative project or field study involving the collection of data from primary research, for example: \u25cf a study of the impact of unemployment on the local community \u25cf a statistical survey of attitudes concerning a social issue such as alcohol or drug use. A field study might consider an issue which lends itself to primary research, for example: \u25cf the impact of peer pressure on teenage mobile phone purchasing \u25cf an investigation into whether teenage binge drinking is a supply-side not a demand-side problem. Using the Extended Project to support breadth and depth There is no specified material that students are expected to study and, in the Extended Project, students are assessed on the quality of the work they produce and the skills they develop and demonstrate through completing this work. Students can use the Extended Project to demonstrate extension in one or more dimensions: \u25cf deepening understanding: where a student explores a topic in greater depth than in the specification content \u25cf broadening skills: where a student learns a new skill. This might be learning how to design a website or learning a new statistical technique which can be used in the analysis of either primary or secondary data collected by the student \u25cf widening perspectives: where the student\u2019s project spans different subjects. A student studying Economics with History may wish to research the influence of an economic thinker such as Keynes or Hayek. A"], ["A_Level_Econ_A_Spec.pdf", "student studying Economics with Geography may wish to research the economic development of a particular country or the impact of an industry on the landscape. A student studying Economics with Mathematics may wish to use statistical techniques to analyse macroeconomic data and research one aspect of the economy in more detail. A student studying Economics with Psychology may wish to conduct an experiment into economic behaviour.
